Worst of the worst. 

Really an organized cartel of Eastern European scam caller ring pretending to be a recruiting firm. 
Actively holds people's resumes/submissisions hostage.
**Asks for where else you are interviewing and blasts out resume to every firm so they have a hold on you**
**Block them on linkedin. NEVER talk to them**

**LITERALY EVIL**
